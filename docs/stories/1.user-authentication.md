# Story 1.1: User Authentication

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to authenticate using my Azure AD credentials,
**so that** I can securely access the system with single sign-on capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can log in using Azure AD authentication
2. Users are redirected to a dashboard after successful authentication
3. Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes
4. Session management works correctly with proper timeout handling
5. Logout functionality properly ends the user session

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement Azure AD authentication flow (AC: 1)
  - [x] Configure Supabase Auth with Azure AD as identity provider
  - [x] Create authentication service to handle login/logout
  - [x] Implement authentication hooks for React components
- [x] Implement post-authentication redirect to dashboard (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create redirect logic after successful authentication
  - [x] Ensure dashboard page is properly protected
- [x] Implement route protection for unauthorized users (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create middleware or HOC for route protection
  - [x] Apply protection to all protected routes
- [x] Implement session management with timeout handling (AC: 4)
  - [x] Configure session timeout settings
  - [x] Implement automatic session refresh
  - [x] Handle session expiration gracefully
- [x] Implement logout functionality (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create logout service method
  - [x] Implement logout button/component
  - [x] Ensure proper session cleanup on logout

## Dependencies
- Supabase project setup with Auth enabled
- Azure AD tenant configured for SSO integration
- Basic Next.js project structure in place

## Dev Notes
### Authentication Implementation Details
- Authentication is handled through Supabase Auth with Azure AD as the identity provider [Source: docs/external-apis.md]
- Session management is automatic with Supabase client libraries [Source: docs/external-apis.md]
- The project uses Next.js 15 with App Router [Source: docs/tech-stack.md]
- Supabase is used for database, authentication, and real-time functionality [Source: docs/tech-stack.md]
