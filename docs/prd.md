# School Request Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Streamline the process of creating and managing various types of requests within a school environment
- Implement a flexible approval workflow system that can accommodate different request types and organizational hierarchies
- Provide role-based access control to ensure appropriate visibility and actions for different user types
- Enable efficient tracking and auditing of all requests and their status changes
- Create a modular system that allows for easy addition of new request types without major architectural changes
- Ensure data security and privacy through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Background Context
The School Request Management System is designed to digitize and streamline various request processes within educational institutions. Many schools still rely on paper-based or email-based systems for handling requests such as supply requests, IT support requests, facility maintenance requests, and more. This leads to inefficiencies, lack of visibility, and difficulty in tracking request status.

The system will provide a centralized platform where teachers and staff can submit various types of requests that then go through automated approval workflows based on predefined rules. The modular design approach allows administrators to configure different workflows for different request types, making the system adaptable to various school structures and requirements.

Key stakeholders include:
- Teachers who submit requests
- Department heads who approve certain requests
- Directors who provide final approvals
- Administrators who configure workflows and manage the system

The system leverages modern web technologies including Next.js 15 with App Router, Supabase for backend services, and follows best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
