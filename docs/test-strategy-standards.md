## Test Strategy and Standards

The test strategy ensures comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the application with a focus on quality and reliability.

### Testing Philosophy

- **Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) where practical, test-after when necessary
- **Coverage Goals:** Minimum 80% code coverage for unit tests, 70% for integration tests
- **Test Pyramid:** 70% unit tests, 25% integration tests, 5% end-to-end tests

### Test Types and Organization

#### Unit Tests

- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0
- **File Convention:** `*.test.ts` colocated with implementation
- **Location:** Same directory as implementation files
- **Mocking Library:** Jest built-in mocking
- **Coverage Requirement:** Minimum 80% coverage for business logic

**AI Agent Requirements:**
- Generate tests for all public methods
- Cover positive, negative, and edge cases
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock all external dependencies

#### Integration Tests

- **Scope:** Database interactions, API endpoints, service integrations
- **Location:** `tests/integration/`
- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - **Database:** Supabase test project with seed data
  - **External APIs:** Mocked with MSW (Mock Service Worker)

#### End-to-End Tests

- **Framework:** Playwright 1.40.0
- **Scope:** Critical user journeys from login to request approval
- **Environment:** Dedicated test environment with seeded data
- **Test Data:** Programmatic data setup for each test

### Test Data Management

- **Strategy:** Factory pattern with deterministic data generation
- **Fixtures:** `tests/fixtures/` directory
- **Factories:** `tests/factories/` directory with factory functions
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup after each test suite

### Continuous Testing

- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions with separate jobs for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Performance Tests:** Load testing with Artillery for critical endpoints
- **Security Tests:** SAST scanning with CodeQL in CI pipeline

### Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Git rollback with redeployment
- **Trigger Conditions:** Failed health checks, critical bugs in production
- **Recovery Time Objective:** 15 minutes for critical issues
